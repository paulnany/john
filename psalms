 	Happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners, or take his place in the way of evil-doers, or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the Lord.	But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and whose mind is on his law day and night.
For the Lord is good, and his mercy is never-ending; his faith is unchanging through all generations.
For the Lord is good, and his mercy is never-ending; his faith is unchanging through all generations.
Come into his doors with joy, and into his house with praise; give him honour, blessing his name.
 	They have hands without feeling, and feet without power of walking; and no sound comes from their throat.
