 	Now there came a time, in the days of the judges, when there was no food in the land. And a certain man went from Beth-lehem-judah, he and his wife and his two sons, to make a living-place in the country of Moab.
1:2	  	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and were there for some time.
1:3	  	And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, came to his end; and only her two sons were with her.
1:4	  	And they took two women of Moab as their wives: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they went on living there for about ten years.
1:5	  	And Mahlon and Chilion came to their end; and the woman was without her two sons and her husband.
